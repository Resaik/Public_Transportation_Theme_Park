# This Project:

Implements the requirements set by the www.iise.org contest problem 6,  
a simulation of a public transport system in a fictious amusement park featuring:

* two different proposed designs for station layouts
* a fixed and a demand driven train schedule 
* a user definable combination of the number of trains and their individual amount of cars 
* an agent based simulation of guests' arrival rates and individual destinations

Using this model:

* we calculated the expected performance and cost for 320 parameter variations 
* and presented our results as a dashboard
